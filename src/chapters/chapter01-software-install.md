## Getting up and running

### Overview

To get started, we need to install and configure the following software first.

* Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
* Visual Studio Code (can use any text editor but workshop tested with Visual Studio Code)
* Node 6.9+
* Angular CLI 1.0.0+

### Goals

* Undersstand how to install the Angular Command Line (CLI)
* Setup your machine for the Workshop

### Windows Showing File Extensions 

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
**Windows Only** 
</div>

**Non-Windows users can [skip to next section](#chapter2.2)**


By default Windows is set to not show file extensions for known files which causes files such as .gitconfig and .npmrc to show up as just a period with no file extension which makes it extremely difficult to figure out what the file actually is.  To fix this we need to turn set Windows Explorer to show file extensions.

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is Microsoft lightweight cross platform IDE.  

1. Download Visual Studio Code at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Once the download finishes, launch the installer except all of the defaults.


### Node.js

NodeJS is used to power the Angular CLI as well as install all of our dependencies.  The Angular CLI requires Node version 6.9 or greater.

1.	Download the latest stable version (LTS) of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) which as of this writing is 6.10.2.    
1.	Run the installer and accept all defaults.
1. Verify that Node installed.  Start a command prompt or terminal window and run: 

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

### Angular CLI Install

The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) makes it so that you do not have to worry about the Angular tooling and can focus instead on your code. You can create new projects, components, modules, services, guards, pipes and routes.  As well it has commands for linting, testing and running our code.  

All of the code that is generated by the Angular CLI following the Angular Style Guide.  

While you do not have to use the Angular CLI, it is highly recommended, will increase your productivity, and this workshop only gives the instructions for developing with the Angular CLI.
