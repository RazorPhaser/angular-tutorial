## Overview

Welcome to the Up and Running with Angular Workshop.  Angular 2 was released in September 2016 and was a full re-write of the framework.  With the re-write a lot has changed.   In this workshop, you will learn how to build an Angular UI from the ground up.

### Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to walk you through creating an application with the common features that a web application would have (headers, footers, forms, calls to API services, authentication, etc).

The tutorial is designed to be gone through from start to finish to build the application as the chapters build on each other.

For each chapter there is a start and complete branch in Github that you can pull down if you need it.

### New Naming Convention

The first thing is what to call Angular.  Angular 1 is now referred to as AngularJS.  Angular 2 and above is referred to as just Angular.  From here on out, we will just call it Angular.  The only time to refer to Angular with a ver sion number is when you are talking about a feature that it specific to that version.  For example, in Angular 4, they add the TitleCase Pipe and an email validator.

### Release Schedule

The second thing is that they are now following SemVer for the versioning of Angular and have a release schedule.  For example, here is how version 2.3.1 would break down.

Release Schedule:

* Major: Every 6 months
* Minor: Every month
* Patch: Every week

### Coming from Angular 1

Third, if you are coming from an AngularJS background, it is best if you do not try to compare the concepts between AngularJS and Angular.  Just treat Angular as a whole new framework.
