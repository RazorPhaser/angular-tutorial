## Overview

Welcome to the Up and Running with Angular Workshop.  Angular 2 was released in September 2016 and was a full re-write of the framework.  With the re-write a lot has changed.   In this workshop, you will learn how to build an Angular UI from the ground up.  We will cover common UI requirements like navigation, footer, forms, Http API calls, routing, modules, and security.


### New Naming Convention

The first thing is what to call Angular.  Angular 1 is now referred to as AngularJS.  Angular 2 and above is referred to as just Angular.  From here on out, we will just call it Angular.  The only time to refer to Angular with a version number is when you are talking about a feature that it specific to that version.  For example, in Angular 4, they add the TitleCase Pipe.

### Release Schedule
The second thing is that they are now following SemVer for the versioning of Angular and have a release schedule.  For example, here is how version 2.3.1 would break down.

Release Schedule:

* Major: Every 6 months
* Minor: Every month
* Patch: Every week

### Coming from Angular 1

Third, if you are coming from an Angular 1 background, it is best if you do not try to compare the concepts between Angular 1 and Angular 2+.  You will be able to learn Angular Just treat Angular 2 as a whole new framework
